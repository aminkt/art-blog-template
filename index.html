                    Depp has taken on the task of challenging himself to portray "larger-than-life" roles, starting with

                <h3>Marilyn Monroe</h3>

                <p>
                    Marilyn Monroe (born Norma Jeane Mortenson; June 1, 1926 – August 5, 1962) was an American actress,
                    model and singer. Famous for playing comic "blonde bombshell" characters, she became one of the most
                    popular sex symbols of the 1950s and was emblematic of the era's attitudes towards sexuality.
                    Although she was a top-billed actress for only a decade, her films grossed $200 million by the time
                    of her unexpected death in 1962. More than half a century later after her death, she continues to be
                    considered a major popular culture icon.<br>
                    Born and raised in Los Angeles, Monroe spent most of her childhood in foster homes and an orphanage
                    and married at the age of sixteen. While working in a radioplane factory in 1944 as part of the war
                    effort, she was introduced to a photographer from the First Motion Picture Unit and began a
                    successful pin-up modeling career. The work led to short-lived film contracts with Twentieth
                    Century-Fox (1946–1947) and Columbia Pictures (1948). After a series of minor film roles, she signed
                    a new contract with Fox in 1951. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress and had roles
                    in several comedies, including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas Clash by
                    Night and Don't Bother to Knock. Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for
                    nude photos before becoming a star, but rather than damaging her career, the story resulted in
                    increased interest in her films.
